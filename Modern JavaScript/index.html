        >JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted and weakly typed programming
        language</a
      >
      which was built with a purpose of
      <a href="img/Screenshot (367).png" target="_blank"
        >running in host environments</a
      >. The code is not pre-compiled but instead evaluated, compiled and
      executed at runtime

        >(e. g. when the browser executes the script)</a

    <p>
      JavaScript assigns types to data containers (variables) at runtime, and
      you can't set the types you want to use in certain places in advance. We
      don't have to explicitly say what
      <a href="img/datatypes/Screenshot (460).png" target="_blank">data type</a>
      a variable will store, we can override a variable with a different type
      too. For that reason JavaScript is known as a loosely typed language in
      contrast to a strongly typed languages like Ruby or Python. In JavaScript
      <a href="img/datatypes/Screenshot (347).png" target="_blank"
        >all data types</a
      >
      are also divided into
      <a href="img/Screenshot (390).png" target="_blank"
        >primitive and reference types</a
      >. It's all to do with
      <a href="img/Screenshot (393).png" target="_blank"
        >how they are stored and used in memory</a
      >. When we store a primitive value in a variable, it adds that value to
      the stack and it locks the variable name to it as an accessor to that
      value. When we store a reference type in a variable, it adds the object to
      the heap and then it adds the pointer to that object on the stack.
      <a href="img/Screenshot (388).png" target="_blank">Variables' names</a>
      can include strings, numbers, underscores and dollar signs, but can not
      include reserved words and can not start with a number.

    <p>
      <a href="img/Screenshot (375).png" target="_blank">Functions</a>
      are one of the main concepts or building blocks of pretty much any
      programming language that you come across, they fall under the object type
      and allow us to define a block of code which we can call and execute
      whenever and as many times as we want.
      <a href="img/Screenshot (376).png" target="_blank"
        >We can reuse functions to make our program more space-efficient and
        easy to read</a
      >. Behind the scenes there is more code, which takes care of say logging
      our message to the console, abstracting (condensing) all that code down to
      a single line. Functions can take in
      <a href="img/Screenshot (384).png" target="_blank"
        >arguments (parameters)</a
      >
      which are variables that we pass into the function in order to be
      manipulated and then either returned back to us, logged to the console, or
      used in another operation. Functions that don't return anything are known
      as 'void' functions. While function is a snippet of code which performs
      some kind of specific task, method is just a function that's associated
      with a particular object or data type.
