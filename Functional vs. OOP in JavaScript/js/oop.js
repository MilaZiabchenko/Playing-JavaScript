// Object-oriented programming

// In OOP we usually change state directly, and all data is wrapped up inside objects as member variables. The only way we can access this data is using an object's methods. In OOP functions are wrapped up inside objects along with the data that they operate on, and these functions allow us to access or make changes to that data. In order to operate on given data we use 'this' keyword.

class Employee {
  constructor(name, salary) {
    (this._name = name), (this._salary = salary);
  }

  raiseSalary(raise) {
    return (this._salary += raise);
  }

  changeEmployee(newName) {
    this._name = newName;
  }
}

const employee = new Employee('Mila', 0);

console.log(employee);

employee.raiseSalary(2500);

console.log(employee);

employee.changeEmployee('Bogdan');
employee.raiseSalary(300);

console.log(employee);

// The main reason, why it's useful to keep data and functions together in the same object in OOP is that this allows us to interact with the member variables of an object without touching them directly. Programmers have access to the variables only through functions, and this way they can keep the variables up to date.

// In OOP data and functions defined within the same class are tightly coupled. In other words, the functions inside the given class usually reference the data that they operate on directly. You can't remove a given function from the class it's in and still make it work on its own.

class Person {
  constructor(firstName, lastName) {
    this._firstName = firstName;
    this._lastName = lastName;
    this._initials = `${firstName.charAt(0)}.${lastName.charAt(0)}.`;
  }

  setFirstName(newName) {
    this._firstName = newName;
    this._initials = `${this._firstName.charAt(0)}.${this._lastName.charAt(
      0
    )}.`;
  }
